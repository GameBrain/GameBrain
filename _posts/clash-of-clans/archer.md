## Overview

The archer is a powerful ranged damage dealer in Clash of Clans. The troop can do a lot of damage from afar but doesnâ€™t have as much hitpoints as other troops. The archer should be paired with a melee unit so that the troop can distract towers from targeting the archer.

## Offensive Strategy
Archers use a mighty bow that can attack enemy buildings and troops from a long distance. They have lower hitpoints than other troops which makes them vulnerable to direct fire from an enemy tower. Make sure to use other troops like the Barbarians and Giant to distract towers away from focusing on the Archer.

You'll need to be careful when using Archers to take down enemy towers that deal splash damage (Wizard Towers, Mortars, ect). Grouped up Archers can die very quickly if hit by those towers. Make sure to place the Archers in small groups surrounding the building so that one hit doesn't wipe out your entire army.

## Defensive Strategy
Archers make excellent troops to have in the Clan Castle because they're able to target both air and ground units. Since she is a tier 1 troops she will be vulnerable to Lightning Spells and Poison Spells.
