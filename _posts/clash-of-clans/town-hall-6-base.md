<p>On this page of our guide, we will show you our recommended base layout for Town Hall 6 in Clash of Clans. The layout is optimized for protecting your resources and trophies from an attacking player.</p>

<p>The December 2015 update brought two major changes that impact base layouts for everyone. The first major change is that the Town Hall will no longer give you a shield if it's destroyed in combat and the second is that the Town Hall gives an attacking player significantly more loot when it's destroyed. As a result, you'll now need to protect the building rather than placing it outside of your base for a free shield.</p>

<h2 class="page-header">TH6 Base Summary</h2>

<p><b>Town Hall</b> - This should be placed in the center of your base. The building no longer grants you a shield if it's destroyed during a raid.</p>

<p><b>Clan Castle</b> - This should be placed near the center of your base and is a key structure for defense. Always have units in the castle so that it can be used for offense and defense.</p>

<p><b>Wizard Tower</b> - These towers do amazing splash damage. Like mortars, they are great against units that are close to one another. Youâ€™ll gain an additional tower at this level for a total of two. The two towers should be placed in the center of your base directly next to the clan castle. They should be placed on opposite sides of each other. The towers are used to help defend your mortars as well as pick off units that are attacking your resources.</p>

<p><b>Archer Tower</b> - Archer towers are very good at providing single target damage. They're able to attack ground and air troops which is very helpful. You'll have the same number of archer towers that you did at Town Hall 5. You should place the three archer towers on the perimeter of your base so that they can protect the buildings outside of the walls.</p>

<p><b>Cannon</b> - The cannon is a great unit for picking off individual troops. It can only target ground troops which means it's vulnerable to air units. You'll have the same number of cannons that you did at the previous town hall. Place the three cannons on the outer corners of your base. They will be very helpful in providing protection to buildings outside of your walls.</p>

<p><b>Mortar</b> - The mortar is a very important defensive unit. It does splash damage and becomes increasingly more powerful as units get clumped up trying to reach the center of your base. You'll gain an extra mortar at this level for a total of two. Place the two mortars in the center of your base directly next to the clan castle. The mortars should be placed on opposite sides of each other.</p>

<p><b>Air Defense</b> - The air defense does tremendous damage to air units. It's a great building for providing defense to areas of your base that are weak to air attacks. You won't gain an extra building at this town hall level so you'll still only have one air defense. Town Hall 6 only has three archer towers so this build places the air defense in the slot that that a fourth archer tower would have been placed. The layout will provide you with air coverage in all four corners of your base.</p>
