<h2  class="page-header">Town Hall Overview</h2>

<p>It's a little easier to collect Dark Elixir at Town Hall 8 because you'll unlock a second Dark Elixir Drill. The second drill will allow you to use Dark Elixir troops more frequently in your army. Now would be a good time to start experimenting with the BAM (Barbarian, Archer, Minion) army composition. The army has a very fast build time and it's great for farming.</p>

<p>Town Hall 8 will also unlock the Skeleton Trap. The trap releases skeletons to attack nearby enemy units. The trap can be toggled to attack air units or ground units.</p>
