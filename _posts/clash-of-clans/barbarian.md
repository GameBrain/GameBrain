## Overview

The barbarian is a mighty melee warrior in Clash of Clans. It can be used as a melee damage dealer or can serve as an inexpensive tanking unit to distract towers and soak up damage on the battlefield. The barbarian is a core troop and is found in a lot of army compositions because of how fast it can be created in the barracks.

## Offensive Strategy

Barbarians can be used as a cheaper alternative to the [Giant](/clash-of-clans/giant/). Although Barbarians have less health individually, you're able to build five Barbarians for the same housing space as one Giant. You'll get roughly 75% of the health as a similar level Giant for roughly 25% of the Elixir cost to create them. Keep in mind that when Barbarians are grouped up they will be vulnerable to splash towers such as the Mortar and Wizard Tower.

## Defensive Strategy

Barbarians can be an excellent choice for a lower level player's Clan Castle because they have relatively high health and only cost one housing space. They're easily capable of delaying and distracting an enemy player's troops.
