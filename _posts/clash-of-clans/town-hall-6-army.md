<h2 class="page-header">TH6 Farming Army</h2>

<p>A farming army is designed for gaining resources quickly. The army is built in a short amount of time and it doesn't take a lot of resources to make. The trade off to these benefits is that the army will not be as strong as other compositions.</p>

<h3>Units</h3>

- x6 Wall Breakers
- x90 Barbarians
- x48 Archers

<p>Try to use a 2:1 ratio between Barbarians and Archers. The easiest way to do this is to follow the Barracks queue below.</p>

- Barracks 1: x2 Wall Breakers, max Barbarians
- Barracks 2: x2 Wall Breakers, max Barbarians
- Barracks 3: x2 Wall Breakers, max Archers

<h3>Spells</h3>

- x2 Healing Spell

<h2 class="page-header">TH6 War and Trophy Army</h2>

<p>The goal of this army is to win an attack against strong opponents. The army takes longer to build but is significantly stronger than a farming army.</p>

<h3>Units</h3>

- x6 Wall Breakers
- x10 Giants
- x12 Wizards
- x2 Healers
- x7 Barbarians
- x5 Archers

<h3>Spells</h3>

- x2 Healing Spell


<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>The Giants will your primary tanking unit in this army. They'll distract the enemy towers while the rest of your units deal damage. The Archers and Barbarians can be used to set off traps and lure troops from the Clan Castle.</p>
