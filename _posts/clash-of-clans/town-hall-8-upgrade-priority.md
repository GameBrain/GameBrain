<h2 class="page-header">TH8 Upgrade Summary</h2>

**Dark Elixir Storage** - Allows you to save more Dark Elixir which can be used to upgrade your Barbarian King or for creating troops.</p>

**Dark Elixir Drill** - You'll unlock a new Dark Elixir Drill at Town Hall 8. These will be very helpful with upgrading your Barbarian King.

**Barbarian King** - The Barbarian King is still very important. Continue to upgrade him as fast as possible.

**Laboratory** - Upgrade your Barbarian and Archers as soon as the Laboratory is complete. They will be the primary units that you use for farming at Town Hall 8.

**Army Camp** - Increases the size of the army you can use during a raid. Having more troops to use will improves your chances of winning an attack.

**Spell Factory** - Unlocks the Rage Spell which is used to increase the speed and damage of troops. The upgrade also allows you to queue and bring an additional spell to combat.

**Gold Mines & Elixir Collectors** - Provides you with more Gold and Elixir per hour than the previous level.

**Gold Storage & Elixir Storage** - Allows you to store more Gold and Elixir than the previous level.

**Wizard Towers** - Very good defensive tower that deals splash damage to ground and air troops.

**Air Defense** - Deals tremendous damage to air units.

**Mortars** - Slow but powerful defensive unit that deals splash damage to ground troops.

**Archer Towers** - Strong single target tower that deals damage to all troops.

**Cannons** - Powerful tower that does single target damage to ground troops.

**Air Sweeper** - Makes it harder for air troops to attack your base.

**Traps** - These towers can quickly put the battle in your favor if you catch the attacker off guard. They cost Gold to rearm so we recommend you wait to upgrade these and put the money towards other buildings which do not cost additional resources to use.

**Walls** - They slow down attacking troops and make it more difficult for someone to destroy your base. You can upgrade your walls sooner in the priority list if you have more resources than you can spend. We recommend that you max all of your walls before moving on to the next Town Hall level.
