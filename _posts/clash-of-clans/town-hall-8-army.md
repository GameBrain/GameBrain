<h2 class="page-header">General Information</h2>

<p>On this page of our guide, we will show you several Town Hall 8 army compositions that can be used for farming, during wars and for gaining trophies.</p>

<p>These recommendations are based on extensive play testing to determine the usefulness of each build.</p>

<div style="clear:both"></div>

<h2 class="page-header">TH8 Farming Army</h2>

<p>A farming army is designed for gaining resources quickly. The army is built in a short amount of time and it doesn't take a lot of resources to make. The trade off to these benefits is that the army will not be as strong as other compositions.</p>

The Town Hall 8 farming army will look very similar to Town Hall 7. The reason for this is because Town Hall 8 doesn't have an army camp upgrade.

<h3>Units</h3>

- x8 Wall Breakers
- x92 Barbarians
- x92 Archers

<p>We recommend using an even split between Barbarians and Archers. This will give balance to your army and is a great starting point for farming. The easiest way to do this is to queue up 2 Wall Breakers In each of your Barracks. Fill the remaining space of 2 Barracks with Archers and the other 2 with Barbarians.</p>

**Build order**

- Barracks 1: x2 Wall Breakers, max Barbarians
- Barracks 2: x2 Wall Breakers, max Barbarians
- Barracks 3: x2 Wall Breakers, max Archers
- Barracks 4: x2 Wall Breakers, max Archers

<h3>Spells</h3>

- 2x Rage Spell
- 1x Healing Spell
- 1x Poison Spell

We recommend using the Poison Spell because it can come in handy when an enemy has strong units in their Clan Castle. You can spare a few of your Barbarians to bait the Clan Castle troops to an open area and then use the Poison Spell to kill them.

<h2 class="page-header">TH8 War and Trophy Army</h2>

<h3>Units</h3>

- x10 Dragons

<h3>Spells</h3>

You'll need to use different spells depending on what level Town Hall you're attacking. As a result, communication and coordinating attacks with your Clan is extremely important during a Clan War.

<h3>Town Hall 7</h3>

- 3x Lightning Spell
- 1x Earthquake Spell

3x Lightning Spells are used when attacking a Town Hall 7 base. You'll drop all of the spells on an opponent's Anti Air tower to destroy it. You'll then send your Dragons to attack the base from the side closest to the last Anti Air tower. The Earthquake Spell can be used to help destroy Anti Air towers.

<h3>Town Hall 8</h3>

- 2x Rage Spell
- 1x Healing Spell
- 1x Earthquake Spell

Rage and Healing Spells are used when attacking a Town Hall 8 player. Town Hall 8 has 3 Anti Air towers so you'll need to use the Rage spells to get your Dragons to destroy the towers quickly. Use the Healing Spell to keep your Dragons alive once they've made it close to the core of the base. The Earthquake Spell can be used to help destroy Anti Air towers.

<h3>Clan Castle</h3>

- 1x Dragon

<p>The Dragon is not always needed when fighting a Town Hall 7 base but it's nice to have the extra firepower in your army. The unit is needed when you're fighting a Town Hall 8 player. Town Hall 8 bases have stronger anti air towers and having an extra Dragon in your army increases your chances of winning.</p>
