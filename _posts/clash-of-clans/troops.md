## Overview
Troops are what you use to attack other players in Clash of Clans. They let you steal resources and trophies from your opponents by raiding their village. Raids are the primary way to get resources to upgrade your base.

Troops can be grouped into a few categories. One category for elixir troops, another for dark elixir troops and one for hero units. Elixir units are created in the [Barracks](/clash-of-clans/barracks/) and dark elixir units are created in the [Dark Barracks](/clash-of-clans/dark-barracks/). Hero units are immortal and are only created once.

Units can be upgraded to make them stronger just like buildings. All troop upgrades are researched in the [Laboratory](/clash-of-clans/laboratory/) building.
