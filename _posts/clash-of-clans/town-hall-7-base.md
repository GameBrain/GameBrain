<p>On this page of our guide, we will show you our recommended base layout for Town Hall 7 in Clash of Clans. The layout is optimized for protecting your resources and trophies from an attacking player.</p>

<p>The December 2015 update brought two major changes that impact base layouts for everyone. The first major change is that the Town Hall will no longer give you a shield if it's destroyed in combat and the second is that the Town Hall gives an attacking player significantly more loot when it's destroyed. As a result, you'll now need to protect the building rather than placing it outside of your base for a free shield.</p>

<h2 class="page-header">TH7 War Base Summary</h2>

<p><b>Town Hall</b> - This should be placed in the center of your base. The building no longer grants you a shield if it’s destroyed during a raid.</p>

<p><b>Clan Castle</b> - This should be placed near the center of your base and is a key structure for defense. Always have units in the castle so that it can be used for offense and defense.</p>

<p><b>Wizard Tower</b> -These towers do amazing splash damage. Like mortars, they are great against units that are close to one another. You’ll have the same number of wizard towers that you had at Town Hall 6. The two towers should be placed on the perimeter of your base and on opposite sides of each other. This placement gives them the best opportunity to attacks units that are grouped up.</p>

<p><b>Archer Tower</b> -Archer towers are very good at providing single target damage. They’re also able to attack ground and air units which them more important than the cannon. You’ll be gaining an extra archer tower at this Town Hall level and you should place all four of them on the outer ring of your base.</p>

<p><b>Cannon</b> - The cannon is a great unit for picking off individual troops. It can only target ground troops and it doesn't have splash damage so it’s best to place the cannon at the outer ring of your base rather than your core. You'll gain two additional cannons at this Town Hall level. The new additions will greatly improve your ability to destroy ground troops.</p>

<p><b>Mortar</b> - Similar to the Clan Castle, this is a very important defensive unit. The mortar does splash damage so it becomes increasingly more powerful as units get clumped up trying to reach the core of your base. You'll gain an extra mortar at Town Hall 7 and all three of them should surround your Town Hall in the center of your base.</p>

<p><b>Air Defense</b> - These do tremendous damage to air units. You’ll gain an extra air defense building at Town Hall 7 which will help you to defend against pesky air troops. The two air defense units should be placed near the middle of your base. Unfortunately, it's hard to cover your entire base efficiently with only two towers. You'll need to place the anti air traps in the areas which are not covered by your air defense buildings.</p>
