<h2 class="page-header">TH6 Overview</h2>

<p>You'll unlock a new trap at Town Hall 6 called the Giant Bomb. The Giant Bomb has a larger splash radius and does more damage than the Bomb trap. It deals enough damage to destroy any tier 1 troop instantly (Barbarian, Archer, Goblin) and can quickly put the odds in your favor if an attacker wasn't expecting it.</p>

<p>Town Hall 6 will also unlock a new building called the Air Sweeper. The Air sweeper shoots gusts of wind to push back enemy air units. It's best used to defend areas of your base that are weak to air units.</p>
